## 1. What is execution context
In computer programming, an execution context refers to the environment in which a piece of code is executed. It includes all the necessary information and resources needed to run the code properly. The execution context typically consists of three main components:

Scope: The scope determines the accessibility and visibility of variables, functions, and objects within the code. It defines the variables and functions that are available for use at any given point during program execution. Scopes can be nested, with each nested scope having access to its parent scope.

Variable Environment: The variable environment component of the execution context stores and manages variables and their values. It keeps track of declared variables, assigns them values, and handles memory allocation and deallocation.

This Binding: The "this" binding refers to the context in which a function is called. It represents the object on which a method is invoked or the global object (e.g., window object in a browser) when a function is called without any specific context.

The execution context is created and maintained by the programming language runtime environment. Whenever a function is called or a block of code is executed, a new execution context is created. The execution context is crucial for managing variable scoping, memory allocation, and determining the value of "this" within a function.
## 2. What is an event loop and call stack
An event loop and a call stack are both concepts related to the execution of code in a programming environment. Let's define each term:

Event Loop: An event loop is a mechanism that enables the asynchronous execution of code in an event-driven programming environment. It is commonly used in environments like JavaScript, which is often executed in web browsers or server-side platforms.
The event loop continuously checks for events or tasks in a queue and executes them in a specific order. Events can include user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks, keyboard input), timers, network responses, or other asynchronous operations. When an event occurs, it is added to the event queue.

The event loop follows a specific order of operations, which typically involves checking the call stack (explained below) and executing tasks in the event queue. It ensures that the code execution remains responsive and non-blocking, allowing multiple tasks to be handled concurrently.

Call Stack: The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a program. It operates as a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack, meaning that the most recently called function is the first one to be resolved or completed.
Whenever a function is invoked, a new frame (or activation record) is added to the top of the call stack, representing that function's execution context. The frame contains information about the function's arguments, local variables, and the program counter indicating the next instruction to be executed.

As functions complete their execution, their frames are removed from the call stack, and the control flow returns to the previous function in the stack. This process continues until the stack becomes empty, indicating that the program has finished executing.

The call stack is essential for maintaining the order of function calls and ensuring proper control flow within a program. It helps keep track of where the program is in its execution and allows for the orderly nesting and execution of functions.
## 3. What is creation phase and execution phase?
The terms "creation phase" and "execution phase" are often used in the context of the JavaScript programming language, specifically when discussing the process of creating and executing functions. Let's delve into each phase:

Creation Phase: The creation phase, also known as the variable instantiation phase or the setup phase, refers to the initial steps taken by the JavaScript engine before executing the code within a specific scope.
During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following tasks:

Variable and Function Hoisting: In this step, all variable and function declarations are processed, and memory space is allocated for them. Variables are assigned the value undefined by default, while function declarations are fully initialized.

Creation of the Scope Chain: The scope chain is established, which determines the order in which variables and functions are resolved during runtime. It allows access to variables and functions from nested scopes.

Binding of "this": The value of the "this" keyword is determined and bound to the appropriate object or context. The specific binding depends on how a function is invoked.

Execution Phase: Once the creation phase is completed, the execution phase begins. This phase involves the actual execution of the code within a given scope.
During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine performs the following actions:

Variable Assignment: Any assignments or operations involving variables are executed in the order they appear in the code.

Function Invocation: When a function is invoked, a new execution context is created, and the function's code is executed within that context. The function's parameters receive values from the arguments provided, and local variables are initialized within the function's scope.

Control Flow: The JavaScript engine follows the control flow of the code, executing statements sequentially unless there are branching or looping constructs that alter the flow.

The creation and execution phases are distinct but interconnected. During the creation phase, the engine sets up the necessary components, including variable and function declarations, scope chains, and "this" binding. In the subsequent execution phase, the code is executed, and the engine carries out the defined operations and control flow.
## 4. What is the spread operator?
The spread operator is a feature introduced in JavaScript ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) that allows an iterable (like an array or a string) to be expanded or spread into individual elements. It is denoted by three consecutive dots: ....

The spread operator can be used in the following ways:

Expanding an Array: When used with an array, the spread operator expands the elements of the array into individual values. It allows you to create a new array by combining existing arrays or adding new elements.

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = [4, 5, 6];

const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Copying an Array: The spread operator can also be used to create a shallow copy of an array.

const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
const copyArray = [...originalArray];

In this example, copyArray will have the same elements as originalArray, but modifying one array will not affect the other.

Passing Arguments to Functions: The spread operator can be used to pass individual elements of an array as arguments to a function. This is particularly useful when the function expects separate arguments instead of an array.

function addNumbers(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const sum = addNumbers(...numbers); // 6

Expanding Objects: In addition to arrays, the spread operator can be used with objects as well. When used with objects, it creates a shallow copy of the object while allowing you to add or overwrite properties.

const obj1 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
const obj2 = { z: 3 };

const combinedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }

## 5. What is the use of setTimeout
The setTimeout function is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to schedule the execution of a function or the evaluation of an expression after a specified delay. It is commonly used for implementing delays, executing code asynchronously, and creating timers in JavaScript. The general syntax of setTimeout is as follows:
setTimeout(callback, delay, arg1, arg2, ...);


The setTimeout function is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to schedule the execution of a function or the evaluation of an expression after a specified delay. It is commonly used for implementing delays, executing code asynchronously, and creating timers in JavaScript. The general syntax of setTimeout is as follows:

javascript
Copy code
setTimeout(callback, delay, arg1, arg2, ...);
The parameters of setTimeout are:

callback: A function or code to be executed after the delay.
delay: The time duration in milliseconds (ms) after which the callback function should be executed.
arg1, arg2, ...: Optional arguments that can be passed to the callback function.
Here's an example that demonstrates the basic usage of setTimeout:

function greet() {
  console.log('Hello, world!');
}

setTimeout(greet, 2000); // After 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds), the greet function will be executed

## 6. What are callbacks?
In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed or called back later at a certain point in the program's execution. The callback function is typically used to specify what should happen after a particular operation or task is completed.

Here are some key points about callbacks:

Higher-Order Functions: Callbacks are commonly used in higher-order functions, which are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return them as results. The higher-order function takes the callback function and invokes it at a specific time or when a certain condition is met.

Asynchronous Operations: Callbacks are extensively used in handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. When performing tasks that take time, such as reading files, making HTTP requests, or executing animations, callbacks provide a way to define what should occur after the operation is finished.

Control Flow: Callbacks enable control flow mechanisms such as event handling, error handling, and looping. By specifying a callback function, you can determine the subsequent steps or actions to be taken based on the outcome or completion of a particular task.

Anonymous Functions: Callback functions can be defined as named functions or anonymous functions. Anonymous functions are often used as callbacks when the logic is concise or specific to a particular context.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of a callback function:

function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
  callback(); // Invoke the callback function
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('John', sayGoodbye);

## 7. What is callback hell
Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom or callback spaghetti, is a term used to describe a situation in asynchronous programming where code becomes difficult to read and maintain due to excessive nesting of callbacks. It arises when multiple asynchronous operations are dependent on each other, resulting in deeply nested callback functions.

Here's an example to illustrate callback hell:

asyncOperation1(function (error, result1) {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  } else {
    asyncOperation2(result1, function (error, result2) {
      if (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
      } else {
        asyncOperation3(result2, function (error, result3) {
          if (error) {
            console.error('Error:', error);
          } else {
            // More nested callbacks...
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
In this example, each asynchronous operation is dependent on the result of the previous operation, leading to multiple levels of indentation and nested callbacks. As more operations are added, the code becomes increasingly difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

Callback hell can make code harder to debug, as errors and exceptions are often buried deep within the nested callbacks. It also makes it challenging to handle error conditions and maintain proper error handling across the codebase.

## 8. Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
The terms "undefined," "not defined," and "NaN" are all related to JavaScript and refer to different concepts. Let's understand each one:

Undefined: In JavaScript, undefined is a special value that indicates the absence of a value or the absence of a specific property or variable assignment. It is a built-in value in JavaScript.

When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is initialized with undefined by default.
When a function does not have a return statement or returns without a value, it implicitly returns undefined.
Accessing an object property that does not exist or accessing an array element beyond its length also yields undefined.
let x; // variable declaration without assignment
console.log(x); // Output: undefined

function foo() {}
console.log(foo()); // Output: undefined

const obj = {};
console.log(obj.property); // Output: undefined

const arr = [];
console.log(arr[5]); // Output: undefined

Not Defined: "Not defined" typically refers to a situation where a variable or identifier is not declared or is not in scope. It indicates that the variable or identifier has not been defined or recognized within the current scope.

Trying to access or use an undeclared variable or identifier will result in a "ReferenceError: not defined" error.
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined

function bar() {
  console.log(z); // ReferenceError: z is not defined
}
bar();

In these examples, y and z are not declared or defined, resulting in a "not defined" error.

NaN: NaN stands for "Not-a-Number" and is a special value in JavaScript that represents the result of an invalid or nonsensical mathematical operation. It indicates that a value is not a valid number according to the JavaScript Number data type.

NaN is typically returned when performing arithmetic operations with values that are not numeric, such as dividing a string by a number, or when a mathematical operation results in an undefined or indeterminate value.
console.log(10 / 'abc'); // Output: NaN

const result = Math.sqrt(-1);
console.log(result); // Output: NaN
